# Random Page Naming Strategy

Generate random unique page names by using UUIDs.
While these page names are not meaningful, they are useful if you do not care about the page name (that shows up in in the URL) and want to have several pages with the same title in the same space.
Typical use cases are threads in forums or calendar entries. 

This page naming strategy is discouraged for public wikis, as meaningful pages names are relevant for search engines.
